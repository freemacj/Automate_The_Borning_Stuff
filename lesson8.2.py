from random import *
spam = randint(1, 10)
print(spam)

'''
Compare this method to lesson8.1
Notice we no longer have to call random.randint(1, 10), because we imported all of the random modules' functions on line 1

THIS METHOD IS NOT PREFERRED, AS IT MAKES YOUR CODE MORE DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND BY OTHERS
